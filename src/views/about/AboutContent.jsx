        As a veteran basketball mom, I understand the challenges that parents
        face when trying to find the right sports programs for their children.
        That's why I created GameUp - to help parents navigate the maze of youth
        sports programs and find the best options for their kids. Starting with
        basketball, we will be rolling out guides for baseball, soccer, tennis,
        and other sports in the near future.

        When my own kids were growing up, I spent countless hours researching
        sports teams and programs. I knew the importance of finding the right
        fit for each child's needs and interests. However, the process was often
        confusing and frustrating, not to mention expensive. We've had our share
        of unreliable coaches, disorganized teams, and organizations that took
        our money without truly developing our children's skills.

      <p>
        That's why I became more intentional in my research and data collection.
        With GameUp, my goal is to provide all families with a reliable resource
        that they can trust. We want to make it easier for parents to find the
        best programs and teams for their children, so they can focus on
        supporting their kids on and off the court.

        My own family has experienced the ups and downs of youth sports. When my
        oldest child, Cole, became interested in basketball at age 4, I didn't
        know where to start. As he grew older and more advanced, I struggled to
        find programs that matched his needs. Cole ended up trying every type of
        basketball program in New York City, from beginner teams to elite
        programs. He even went on to play college basketball at the University
        of North Carolina and was eventually drafted by the Orlando Magic.

        When my daughter, Ella, started playing a few years later, it was even
        harder to find quality programs for girls. She played for various AAU
        teams in the tri-state area before winning her high school state
        championship and being named New York State co-player of the year in
        2020.

        By the time my youngest child, Leo, began competing, I had finally found
        my way through the youth basketball maze. All of the research I had done
        in the past made it much easier to find the right programs for Leo. He
        even won the 2022 third grade AAU world championship!

        As a parent, I know how much we all want the best opportunities for our
        children. GameUp is here to save you time, money, and effort, while
        helping your child become their absolute best on and off the court.
